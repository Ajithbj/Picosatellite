A temperature sensor is an electronic device that measures the temperature of its
environment and converts the input data into electronic data to record, monitor, or signal
temperature changes. There are many different types of temperature sensors. Some
temperature sensors require direct contact with the physical object that is being monitored
(contact temperature sensors), while others indirectly measure the temperature of an object
(non-contact temperature sensors\

Gyroscope:
 gyroscopes are motion sensors that detect and measure the angular motion of an
object
In a spacecraft, gyroscopes tell the onboard computer when the craft has changed its
attitude (direction and pointing).
